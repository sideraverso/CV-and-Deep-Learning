    "* **Learning rate schedule**: A constant learning rate can be utilized during the training of a neural network, but this can increase the amount of training that has to take place to arrive at optimal neural network performance. By utilizing the learning rate schedule, we introduce a timely reduction or increment of the learning rate during training to arrive at an optimal training outcome of the neural network.\n",

    "* **Learning rate Decay**: Learning rate decay reduces the oscillations of steps taken towards a local minimum during gradient descent. By reducing the learning rate to a smaller value compares to the learning rate value utilized at the start of the training, we can steer the network towards a solution that oscillates in smaller ranges around a minimum.\n",

    "* **Loss Function**: This is a method that quantifies ‘how well’ a machine learning model performs. The quantification is an output(cost) based on a set of inputs, which are referred to as parameter values. The parameter values are used to estimate a prediction, and the ‘loss’ is the difference between the prediction and the actual values.\n",

    "In the following cell the optimizer used for model compilation if instansiated along with sets of values passed into the Keras's implementation of Stotastic Gradient Decent (SGD) [`keras.optimizers.SGD()`](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/sgd/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's paint a picture. We have a loss function, and we need to find the optimum solution to solve the loss function. Here comes gradient descent, an algorithm that works by making changes to the values of the parameters/weight values that are within the model, all in the purpose of minimizing the cost function. An example of a loss function is Mean Squared Error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent intrinsic functionality works by finding the direction to take towards a local minimum based on the calculated gradient obtained from the error function with respect to the parameters at a particular data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stotastic Gradient Decent (SGD) works by actually picking a single data point from the training set and computing the gradient, based on this single data point. Updates made within the parameter space during gradient descent can be noisy when using SGD. The noisiness characteristic of SGD is a result of its random nature that occurs when selecting data points from the training set to compute gradients from at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function leveraged for the neural network implemented in this notebook is [Sparse Categorical Crossentropy](https://keras.io/api/losses/probabilistic_losses/#sparsecategoricalcrossentropy-class). This loss function is preferred when conducting classification on multiple labels."

If a batch size numner is not specified, the default batch size within Keras when training a neural network is 32. The network implemented in this notebook is trained for a total of 60 epochs. \n",
